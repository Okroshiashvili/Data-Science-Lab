# Data Science Laboratory

In this repository, I put some Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms.
Some of them come from various MOOC's and some of them are my work.


## Aim

The goal of this repository is to help aspiring data scientists to understand what happens behind the code and don't blindly copy paste it. I've done this with extensive comments in code files.
I tried to be as detailed as possible, but surely, some googling will also help.


## How to use

You can clone the repository and in your favorite IDE set the working directory to that folder.
Data sets are in each folder, except for Convolutional Neural Networks, for which you can download data from provided link in the code file. I left the data folder and some pictures in it for guidance on how to prepare data folder for CNN. These are really toy data sets, just for learning purposes. I do hope it will make a difference.
