# Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning
In this repo I put some Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms.
Some of them comes from various MOOCs and some of them is my work.
From time to time I'll add some contents and improve existing ones.

### My aim is twofold
* Keep my work and access it from everywhare
* The most important to help somehow Data Science enthusiast to catch algorithm relatively easily.

One can download the repository and in spyder or other favorite IDE set working directory to that folder. 
Datasets are in each folder. These are really really toy datasets, just for learning purposes. While updating the content
of this repo I'll add some specific as well as general datasets


#### Contributors are warmly welcomed
