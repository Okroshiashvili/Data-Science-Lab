# Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning
In this repository, I put some Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms.
Some of them come from various MOOCs and some of them are my work.


### Aim

The goal of this repository is to help aspiring data scientists to understand what happens behind the code and don't blindly copy paste it. I've done this with extensive comments in code files.
I tried to be as detailed as possible, but surely, some googling will also help.


### How to use

You can clone the repository and in spyder or in your other favorite IDE set the working directory to that folder. 
Datasets are in each folder, except for Convolutional Neural Networks, for which you can download data from provided link in the code file. I left the data folder and some pictures in it for guidance on how to prepare data folder directory for CNN. These are really toy datasets, just for learning purposes. I do hope it will make a difference.


### Major Update

In 27-Jan-2019 repo got some major updates.

* Separated ML and DL algorithms in different folders
* Added more comments in each code file
* Extended DL with supervised and unsupervised algorithms
* Easily generalizable code for other datasets
* Materials for farther reading in Deep Learning

### To Do

* Add more intuitions for each algorithm and problem
* Add some more algorithms
* Each folder will have to have a brief description of algorithms with farther references
