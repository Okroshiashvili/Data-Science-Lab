# Machine Learning

In this folder, there are various machine learning algorithms. Each code file contains comments where I tried to be as detailed as possible to make the code more understandable.

* Supervised Machine Learning

    * Regression
    * Classification
    * Boosting


* Unsupervised Machine Learning

    * Association Rule Learning
    * Dimensionality Reduction
    * Clustering



Furthermore, there are *Model Selection* and *Data Preprocessing* folders, which contains simple data preprocessing steps as well as model validation and grid search methods.
